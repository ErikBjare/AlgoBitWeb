AlgoBitWeb
==========

A web-monitor for a very old version of my Bitcoin trading-bot AlgoBit.

Runs on Google App Engine, supported (supports?) fetching trade-history from the swedish Bitcoin market [Kapiton](http://kapiton.se/).

No longer supported by the bot which development has spiraled in directions which rendered this project useless in comparison. So as of today (2014/01/17) I'm making this a public repo.
